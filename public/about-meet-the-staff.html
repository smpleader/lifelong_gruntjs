                                            Working for LifeLong is close to her heart, as she too was adopted. Jennifer know's how much love, strength and courage a birthmother and birthfather have in order to make this unselfish and life-altering decision. Growing up in a gracious and loving family with two adopted siblings she brings compassion and experience to her job in creating profiles for our families. Jennifer has had the experience of meeting her biological mother and father and truly respects the decisions they had to make. Jennifer’s adoptive mother always told her, "you weren’t born under my heart, but you were born in it." Jennifer has felt these words every day of her life. Creating profiles and working with LifeLong brings her great satisfaction in helping other families along this journey. Jennifer wishes you the best throughout your adoption.

                                            Working for LifeLong is close to her heart, as she too was adopted. Jennifer know's how much love, strength and courage a birthmother and birthfather have in order to make this unselfish and life-altering decision. Growing up in a gracious and loving family with two adopted siblings she brings compassion and experience to her job in creating profiles for our families. Jennifer has had the experience of meeting her biological mother and father and truly respects the decisions they had to make. Jennifer’s adoptive mother always told her, "you weren’t born under my heart, but you were born in it." Jennifer has felt these words every day of her life. Creating profiles and working with LifeLong brings her great satisfaction in helping other families along this journey. Jennifer wishes you the best throughout your adoption.

                                            Working for LifeLong is close to her heart, as she too was adopted. Jennifer know's how much love, strength and courage a birthmother and birthfather have in order to make this unselfish and life-altering decision. Growing up in a gracious and loving family with two adopted siblings she brings compassion and experience to her job in creating profiles for our families. Jennifer has had the experience of meeting her biological mother and father and truly respects the decisions they had to make. Jennifer’s adoptive mother always told her, "you weren’t born under my heart, but you were born in it." Jennifer has felt these words every day of her life. Creating profiles and working with LifeLong brings her great satisfaction in helping other families along this journey. Jennifer wishes you the best throughout your adoption.
