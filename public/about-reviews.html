They are there every step of the way and truly care that you are able to adopt! There is no rhyme or reason as to why a birthmom chooses you! I do know that by listening to them, they have made our dream a reality! If you feel something is not working then be proactive and have them help you! Good luck to those future adoptive parents and thank you LifeLong Adoptions!”</p>

They didn't make me feel bad for not wanting to be the mom, they were really nice and respectful. If there are any other girls that are in a situation like I was in, they should give LifeLong a call because it was the best choice for me.”</p>

                                <p>“We were connected with our birthmother via LifeLong, leading to the adoption of our amazing babies. From the time our profile was first posted to the birth of our children, less than nine months passed. Throughout this time and since, LifeLong staff have been consistently available and highly supportive. Their involvement included providing both pragmatic assistance and emotional support in navigating various, unavoidable, case-specific difficulties along the road, as well as celebrating the birth of our babies and our subsequent homecoming. As time has passed, we remain in touch with LifeLong staff, who have become friends with a special reverence, given their unique role in our becoming a family.”</p>

                                <p>After six months of interviewing various adoption agencies across the country, we settled on LifeLong Adoptions for a variety of reasons. The top reason was LifeLong’s relationship and bond they obviously have with the birthmothers. My partner and I wanted a baby of course...but we also wanted the person who was granting us this gift to be taken care of on a number of different levels. We wanted their questions answered by the best of the best, someone to go to when their emotions were running high. LifeLong offered that for these women. Secondly, we chose LifeLong for their honest candor and their commitment to communication.” </p>

I sat late at night on the internet and came across LifeLong’s website. I requested information and heard back almost right away. I was relieved to not have adoption pushed on me but it be my choice instead. We looked at many families and found one that stood out to us. We texted and spoke on the phone. They even came and met both of us and we spent a weekend together. LifeLong truly helped us make this choice and feel good about it. I just wish more people struggling with this decision could find LifeLong. They will feel such relief and know that whatever their decision is is the right one for them. Thank you so much for all your love and support!”</p>

                                <p>“Our dream came true through LifeLong Adoptions because we now have a little baby boy that we wanted since we got married. Life had other obstacles planned for us and we went through years of infertility and heartache. Working with the ladies at LifeLong made me feel I was not alone. They have been through my pain and they listened!! They help us step by step from the first phone call, where to get a home study, creating our profile, talking with a birthmother for the first time, and of course what to do when our BM went into labor. They shared in our joy of bringing home our baby. Our journey was their journey also and they shared in our joy of bring our baby home.”</p>

They build relationships with their birthmothers and ensure they stay healthy emotionally and physically. Ultimately, the true test is that we very quickly felt comfortable speaking with the staff, sharing our concerns, and sharing in the joys as we prepared, were matched, and after the birth of our daughter.”</p>

While, yes, it’s a lot of money upfront, they are VERY good with all forms of communication throughout the entire process and made everything incredibly smooth for us. From the time we joined and our page went up, it was nine months until we were holding our son in our arms. There were many ups and downs having to do with the hospital and family situation and everyone at LifeLong was there to listen, help and advise through it all. I couldn’t be happier with our experience.”</p>

They are an all-around compassionate team who are fully invested in their clients. They were so sensitive to our struggles leading up to finding them and handled us with kid gloves throughout the entire process. They told us who to call, where to go, and what to expect at every turn to make sure all our bases were covered, from the home study to the hotel where we waited to bring our baby home.”</p>

                                <p>“We had a great overall experience with LifeLong Adoptions and we also would choose Mark over anybody to work with as he is so attentive to your needs and responds very quickly even if it's the weekend or late at nights. We really feel Mark knows his stuff and basically held our hand every step of the way. This was our first experience with adoption and we were nervous about writing a check that large not knowing what to expect! In my opinion, LifeLong is small enough that they can spend more time on both the prospective adoptive parents and can also filter out potential birthmoms to make a great connection between the two.”</p>

The rude questions, demanding ID and proof of pregnancy, etc. LifeLong was like a breath of fresh air. What struck me immediately was the kindness and caring they showed. I was treated like a person and not a host carrying a child for someone else. All of my initial questions were answered in the first two phone calls and many more over text and email. Texts, emails and calls were immediately returned. . . . I can't say enough great things about them. If you are looking for a personal relationship and knowledgeable professionals this is the place for you!”</p>

After researching many agencies and talking with many people I decided to go with LifeLong Adoptions. They clearly and accurately laid out the process and I felt I could call them at any time if I had a question. They let me know their average adoption wait time (which from viewing the website and seeing waiting parents profiles turn into "connected" and "adopted" I found to be accurate), but they never promised anything.”</p>
